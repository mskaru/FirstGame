Baby Development: Four to Six Months

During these months, babies are really learning to reach out and manipulate the world around them. They’re mastering the use of those amazing tools, their hands. And they’re discovering their voices. From 4 to 6 months old, your baby will probably:

    Roll over from front to back or back to front. Front-to-back usually comes first.
    Babble, making sounds that can sound like real language.
    Laugh.
    Reach out for and grab objects (watch out for your hair), and manipulate toys and other objects with her hands.
    Sit up with support and have great head control.

 
Baby Development: Seven to Nine Months

During the second half of this year, your little one becomes a baby on the go. After learning that he can get somewhere by rolling over, he’ll spend the next few months figuring out how to move forward or backward. If you haven’t baby-proofed yet, better get on it!

    During this time period, your baby may:
    Start to crawl. This can include scooting (propelling around on his bottom) or “army crawling” (dragging himself on his tummy by arms and legs), as well as standard crawling on hands and knees. Some babies never crawl, moving directly to from scooting to walking.
    Sit without support.
    Respond to familiar words like his name. He may also respond to “No” by briefly stopping and looking at you, and may start babbling "Mama" and "Dada."
    Clap and play games such as patty-cake and peekaboo.
    Learn to pull up to a standing position.

The last development stage in baby’s first year is quite a transition. She isn’t an infant anymore, and she might look and act more like a toddler. But she’s still a baby in many ways. She’s learning to:

    Begin feeding herself. Babies at this developmental stage master the “pincer grasp“ -- meaning they can hold small objects such as O-shaped cereal between their thumb and forefinger.
    Cruise, or move around the room on her feet while holding onto the furniture.
    Say one or two words, and "Mama" and "Dada" become specific name for parents. The average is about three spoken words by the first birthday, but the range on this is enormous.
    Point at objects she wants in order to get your attention.
    Begin “pretend play” by copying you or using objects correctly, such as pretending to talk on the phone. 
    Take her first steps. This usually happens right around one year, but it can vary greatly.
